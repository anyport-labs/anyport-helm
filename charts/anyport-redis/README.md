# anyport-redis

The chart behind the **Redis** entry in Anyport's managed-services catalog. Users never run this
themselves — `InstallPlugin` provisions it through a `HelmApp` and the console renders the two
choices (mode, size) that map onto its values.

## Why a first-party chart

The catalog originally pinned `bitnami/redis`. That is a dead end:

- Broadcom withdrew Bitnami's public image catalog — the tags that chart hardcodes
  (`docker.io/bitnami/redis:7.4.0-debian-12-r0`) return 404, and the frozen `bitnamilegacy/*`
  mirror gets no security patches.
- It declares its `common` dependency over `oci://`, which the HelmApp controller's
  classic-repo dependency builder cannot resolve.
- Its value surface assumes nested YAML (`extraFlags` is a list), while the console pushes flat
  `--set` scalars. Half the old overlay's keys were silently no-ops as a result.

Owning the chart removes all three at once and pins the images we choose. See
[docs/plugins/PHASE-5-redis.md](../../docs/plugins/PHASE-5-redis.md).

## Valkey, not Redis

`image.repository` defaults to `valkey/valkey` — the BSD-3 Linux Foundation fork. Redis Inc.'s
RSALv2/SSPL terms restrict offering the software as a managed service, which is close enough to
what Anyport does to sidestep; Valkey is wire- and command-compatible and is what Render, AWS and
GCP moved their managed offerings to. The catalog still presents it as "Redis" because that is
what users search for.

To run upstream Redis instead:

```
--set image.repository=redis --set image.tag=7-alpine \
--set binary.server=redis-server --set binary.cli=redis-cli
```

## Credentials

The chart **never generates a password** and refuses to render without `auth.existingSecret`.
The platform writes `redis-auth-<instance>` before provisioning, so the credential exists only
in-cluster and never reaches MongoDB. The app-facing copy (`service-conn-<instance>`) is a
separate secret containing only valid environment-variable keys.

## Modes

| | Cache (default) | Durable |
|---|---|---|
| `persistence.enabled` | `false` | `true` |
| Volume | none (emptyDir) | PVC, `persistence.size` |
| RDB/AOF | `save ""`, appendonly off | periodic `save` + optional AOF |
| `maxmemoryPolicy` | `allkeys-lru` | `noeviction` |
| Restart | data lost | data retained |

`maxmemory` is set below the container memory limit on purpose: the server should evict (an
observable, recoverable event) rather than be OOM-killed by the kernel.

## Publishing

Released by [`release-charts.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-charts.yml) in the anyport repo:
it syncs every chart in `helms/` to `anyport-labs/anyport-helm` and tags it, and anyport-helm's Release
workflow matrixes over `charts/*`, packaging each and pushing it to `oci://ghcr.io/anyport-labs`
plus a GitHub Release. All charts share one version (lockstep).

The console pins `redisChartVersion` in `domain/plugins/catalog.go` — bump it in the same release,
and never republish an existing version with different content.

**One-time, after the first push:** make the `anyport-redis` GHCR package **public**. GHCR packages
are private on creation, and agents pull anonymously.

## Local check

```bash
helm lint helms/redis --set auth.existingSecret=x
helm template t helms/redis --set auth.existingSecret=x --set persistence.enabled=true
```
