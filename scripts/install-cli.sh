# Install the Anyport CLI.

# Usage:
#   curl -sfL https://anyport.dev/cli.sh | sh
#   curl -sfL https://anyport.dev/cli.sh | sh -s -- --init        # then run `anyport init`
#   curl -sfL https://anyport.dev/cli.sh | sh -s -- v0.1.0        # pin a version
#   curl -sfL https://anyport.dev/cli.sh | ANYPORT_INSTALL_DIR=~/bin sh
#
# POSIX sh only. This runs under `sh`, which is dash on Debian/Ubuntu: `set -o pipefail`
# aborts the script on line 1 there, and `&>/dev/null` means "run in background".
